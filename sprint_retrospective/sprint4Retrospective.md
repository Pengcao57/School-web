	  - security: A
	  - maintenability: A
  

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
	- There isn't any huge mistake in estimation probably due to the fact that we improved in estimating with experience. 

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
	- POSITIVE: we learnt how to do automated E2E testing and that it allows you to always test the whole system.
	- NEGATIVE: we learnt that fixing technical debt at the end of a task is more time consuming than doing it step by step.   

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
	- we completed the automated E2E testing.
	- we finished the tasks some days before the demo so we had more time to prepare the demo. 
   
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
	- we were able to achive our goals.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
	- we are proud that we were able to work together without any clash among us for the whole project and that we were able to grow personally and as a team.
